# advanced-SQL

This is a collection of advanced SQL concepts and example queries using PostgreSQL 14.9 (Homebrew Install) on aarch64-apple-darwin21.6.0.

This repository often cites text from the [PostgreSQL 14 Documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/14/index.html).

Some examples use the [Northwind Sample Database](https://github.com/pthom/northwind_psql/blob/master/northwind.sql) adapted for PostgreSQL.

OpenAI's GPT-4 was used to generate mock data. The prompt's used to generate the mock data are in the `gpt4-prompts.md` file.
